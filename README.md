# Tiny Backup

... Is a minimal backup solution for Blender. It adds a new button to Blender under the "File" menu that creates a seperate (timestamped) backup file. These files will be stored into a seperate folder called "backup", right next to you original blend file.


Some core parts of the code are based on this script https://github.com/sambler/addonsByMe/blob/master/file_prefix.py
